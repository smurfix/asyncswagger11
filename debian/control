Description: Asynchronous library for accessing Swagger-1.1-enabled APIs
 asyncswagger11 is an anyio-compatible clone of swagger.py, capable of
 understanding Swagger 1.1 definitions (only).
 .
 As swagger has been renamed to OpenAPI which by now has version 3.0
 (and has an actual specification â€“ unlike Swagger 1.1) this library is
 (mostly) only usable with Asterisk, which still uses Swagger 1.1
 declarations.
 .
 asyncswagger11 supports a WebSocket extension, allowing a WebSocket to
 be documented, and auto-generated WebSocket client code.
